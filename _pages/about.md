  <p>Howdy!</p>

  <p>
I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Nitesh Saxena at <a href="https://spies.engr.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">SPIES Lab</a>, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA.

I began my Ph.D. in Spring 2022, and my broader research interests lie in emerging systems security. My recent work focuses on user-centered and HCI security, particularly accessibility-triggered security issues in digital systems. This includes authentication mechanisms, cookie banners, and device linking and browser syncing workflows for diverse user populations, with the goal of identifying security leakages that disproportionately affect these users and ensuring secure authentication for emerging platforms such as AR/VR devices.

    I have published several papers in prestigious, top-tier venues, including <b style="color:blue;">ACM CCS</b> (3 papers), <b style="color:blue;">The Web Conference (WWW)</b>, and <b style="color:blue;">USENIX Security</b>, along with publications in respected journals and contributions to book chapters. I also have several projects currently under review at top-tier venues, as well as others in progress, with planned submissions to leading conferences and journals.
