  <p>Howdy!</p>

  <p>
I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Nitesh Saxena at <a href="https://spies.engr.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">SPIES Lab</a>, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA.

    I began my Ph.D. in Spring 2022, and my broader research interests lie in emerging systems security, while my recent work focuses on the intersection of security and accessibility (accessibility-triggered security) in digital systems. This includes authentication mechanisms for diverse users, identifying security leakages that affect them, and ensuring secure authentication for emerging platforms such as AR/VR devices. I have published several papers in prestigious, top-tier venues, including <b style="color:blue;">ACM CCS</b> (3 papers), <b style="color:blue;">The Web Conference (WWW)</b>, and <b style="color:blue;">USENIX Security</b>, along with publications in respected journals and contributions to book chapters. I also have several projects under review at top-tier venues and others in progress, with submissions planned for leading conferences and journals.
