Howdy!

I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Nitesh Saxena](https://nsaxena.engr.tamu.edu/) at [SPIES Lab](https://spies.engr.tamu.edu/home-3/), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html), College Station, Texas, USA. 

I began my PhD in Spring 2022, and my research interests lie at the intersection of security and accessibility in digital systems, including a focus on authentication mechanisms for diverse users, identifying security leakages affecting them, and ensuring secure authentication mechanisms for emerging platforms such as AR/VR devices. I have published several papers in prestigious, top-tier venues, including <b style="color:blue;">ACM CCS</b> (two papers), <b style="color:blue;">The Web Conference (WWW)</b>, and <b style="color:blue;">USENIX Security</b>, as well as in respected journals and book chapters. I also have several projects currently under review or in progress, with planned submissions to leading venues.
