  <p>Howdy!</p>

  <p>
I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Nitesh Saxena at <a href="https://spies.engr.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">SPIES Lab</a>, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA.

I began my Ph.D. in Spring 2022, and my broader research interests lie in emerging systems security. My recent work focuses on user-centered and HCI security, including accessibility-triggered security issues in digital systems for diverse user populations, with the goal of identifying security leakages that disproportionately affect these users and propagate to impact the broader user population, while ensuring that such risks are identified and mitigated before they can cause harm. Additionally, my recent work includes investigating the security of AR/VR devices, examining how motion sensor data can enable the reconstruction of sensitive information, including users’ gender, and developing effortless authentication mechanisms for these devices.

    I have published several papers in prestigious, top-tier venues, including <b style="color:blue;">ACM CCS</b> (three papers), <b style="color:blue;">The Web Conference (WWW)</b>, and <b style="color:blue;">USENIX Security</b>, including a <b style="color:blue;">Distinguished Paper Award</b> at ACM CCS 2025. In addition, I have published in respected journals and contributed to book chapters. I also have several projects currently under review at top-tier venues, as well as others in progress, with planned submissions to leading conferences and journals.
