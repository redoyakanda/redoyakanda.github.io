  <p>Howdy!</p>

  <p>
    I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Nitesh Saxena at SPIES Lab, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA.

    I began my PhD in Spring 2022, and my research interests lie at the intersection of security and accessibility in digital systems, including a focus on authentication mechanisms for diverse users, identifying security leakages affecting them, and ensuring secure authentication mechanisms for emerging platforms such as AR/VR devices. I have published several papers in prestigious, top-tier venues, including <b style="color:blue;">ACM CCS</b> (3 papers), <b style="color:blue;">The Web Conference (WWW)</b>, and <b style="color:blue;">USENIX Security</b>, along with publications in respected journals and contributions to book chapters. I also have several projects under review in top-tier venues and others in progress, with submissions planned for leading conferences and journals.
