Howdy!

I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Nitesh Saxena](https://nsaxena.engr.tamu.edu/) at [SPIES Lab](https://spies.engr.tamu.edu/home-3/), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html), College Station, Texas, USA. 

I started my PhD in Spring 2022, and my research interests align with the security of authentication systems for diverse groups, such as blind and visually impaired users. Additionally, I am working on AR/VR security. I have published several papers in prestigious journals, conferences, and book chapters. Additionally, I have several ongoing projects that are in progress and on track for submission.
