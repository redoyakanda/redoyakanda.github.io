My research interests lie at the intersection of security and accessibility, focusing on ensuring secure and inclusive digital systems, including authentication mechanisms for diverse user groups, particularly blind and visually impaired users. Additionally, I explore emerging device security, such as AR/VR technologies, with a particular emphasis on identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring appropriate solutions. Through my research, I aim to enhance the security, usability, and accessibility of digital systems, ensuring equitable access for all users while mitigating emerging threats.
