My broader research interest lies in ensuring the security of emerging digital systems. With this overarching goal, I began by focusing on authentication mechanisms, which serve as the first line of defense against unauthorized access to user accounts. In particular, I examine authentication from the perspective of diverse user groups, including blind and visually impaired individuals, an underexplored area where accessibility limitations can directly translate into concrete security risks. I then extend this line of inquiry to other emerging digital systems, conducting user-centered and HCI security research that includes accessibility-triggered security problems. By systematically identifying and analyzing these challenges, my work aims to inform the design of digital systems that are both secure and inclusive.<br><br>

In addition to authentication, I also investigate the security of emerging technologies such as augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR). Here, my emphasis is on identifying unique vulnerabilities that arise in immersive environments and designing appropriate mitigations that preserve both usability and protection. <br><br>

Across these efforts, my research seeks to bridge the gap between usability, accessibility, and security, ultimately aiming to ensure equitable access while mitigating evolving threats in next-generation digital systems.
