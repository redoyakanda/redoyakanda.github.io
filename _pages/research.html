My broader research interest lies in ensuring the security of emerging systems. With this overarching goal in mind, I began by focusing on authentication systems, which form the first line of defense against unauthorized access to user accounts. In particular, I examine authentication from the perspective of diverse user groups, including blind and visually impaired individuals, an underexplored area where accessibility limitations can directly translate into security risks. By systematically analyzing and addressing these challenges, my work contributes to building digital systems that are both secure and inclusive.

In addition to authentication, I also investigate the security of emerging technologies such as augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR). Here, my emphasis is on identifying unique vulnerabilities that arise in immersive environments and designing appropriate mitigations that preserve both usability and protection. Across these efforts, my research seeks to bridge the gap between usability, accessibility, and security, ultimately aiming to ensure equitable access while mitigating evolving threats in next-generation digital systems.
