My broader research interest lies in ensuring the security of emerging digital systems while accounting for usability and accessibility to support inclusive and equitable use. With this overarching goal, I began by studying authentication mechanisms, which serve as a critical component of system security and user protection. In particular, I examine authentication from the perspective of diverse user groups, including blind and visually impaired individuals, an underexplored area where accessibility limitations can directly translate into concrete security risks. I then extend this line of inquiry to other emerging digital systems, conducting user-centered and HCI security research that includes accessibility-triggered security problems. By systematically identifying and analyzing these challenges, my work aims to inform the design of digital systems that are both secure and inclusive.<br><br>

In addition, I investigate the security of emerging technologies such as augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR). My work in this area focuses on uncovering new attack surfaces introduced by immersive platforms, including the leakage of sensitive user information through subtle motion sensor signals. I further study how such leakage can threaten user privacy and identity and develop secure and usable authentication mechanisms tailored to immersive environments. <b style="color:blue;">This line of research includes a distinguished paper award–winning contribution at ACM CCS 2025.</b> <br><br>

Across these efforts, my research seeks to bridge the gap between usability, accessibility, and security, with the goal of ensuring equitable access while mitigating evolving threats in next-generation digital systems.
